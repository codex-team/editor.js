# Installation Guide

There are few steps to run Editor.js on your site.

1. [Load Editor's core](#load-editors-core)
2. [Load Tools](#load-tools)
3. [Initialize Editor's instance](#create-editor-instance)

## Load Editor's core

Firstly you need to get Editor.js itself. It is a [minified script](../dist/editor.js) with minimal available

Choose the most usable method of getting an Editor for you.

- Node package
- Source from CDN
- Local file from a project

### Node.js

Install the package via NPM or Yarn

```shell
npm i @editorjs/editorjs
```

Include module at your application

```javascript
import EditorJS from '@editorjs/editorjs';
```

### Use from CDN

You can load specific version of package from [jsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@editorjs/editorjs).

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@editorjs/editorjs@2.10.0`

Then require this script.

```html
<script src="..."></script>
```

### Save sources to project

Copy [editor.js](../dist/editor.js) file to your project and load it.

```html
<script src="editor.js"></script>
```

## Load Tools

Each Block at the Editor.js represented by [Tools](tools.md). There are simple external scripts with their own logic. You'll probably want to use several Block Tools that should be connected.

For example, check out our [Header](https://github.com/editor-js/header) Tool that represents heading blocks.

You can install the Header Tool via the same ways as an Editor (Node.js, CDN, local file).

Check [Editor.js's community](https://github.com/editor-js/) to see Tools examples.

**Example:** use Header from CDN

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/codex.editor.header@2.1.0/dist/bundle.js"></script>
```

## Create Editor instance

Create an instance of Editor.js and pass [Configuration Object](../src/types-internal/editor-config.ts).
At least the `holderId` option is required.

```html
<div id="editorjs"></div>
```

You can create a simple Editor only with a default Paragraph Tool by passing a string with element's Id (wrapper for Editor) as a configuration param or use default `editorjs`.

```javascript
var editor = new EditorJS(); /** Zero-configuration */

// equals

var editor = new EditorJS('editorjs');
````

Or pass a whole settings object.

```javascript
var editor = new EditorJS({
    /**
     * Create a holder for the Editor and pass its ID
     */
    holderId : 'editorjs',

    /**
     * Available Tools list.
     * Pass Tool's class or Settings object for each Tool you want to use
     */
    tools: {
        header: {
          class: Header,
          inlineToolbar : true
        },
        // ...
    },

    /**
     * Previously saved data that should be rendered
     */
    data: {}
});
```

## Ready callback

Editor.js needs a bit of time to initialize. It is an asynchronous action so it won't block execution of your main script.

If you need to know when the editor instance is ready you can use one of the following ways:

##### Pass `onReady` property to the configuration object.

It must be a function:

```javascript
var editor = new EditorJS({
   // Other configuration properties

   /**
    * onReady callback
    */
   onReady: () => {console.log('Editor.js is ready to work!')}
});
```

#### Use `isReady` promise.

After you create a new `EditorJS` object it will contain `isReady` property.
It is a Promise object that resolves when the editor will be ready to work and rejected otherwise.
If there is an error during initialization `isReady` promise will be rejected with an error message.

```javascript
var editor = new EditorJS();

editor.isReady
  .then(() => {
    /** Do anything you need after editor initialization */
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    console.log(`Editor.js initialization failed because of ${reason}`)
  });
```

You can use `async/await` to keep your code looking synchronous:

```javascript
var editor = new EditorJS();

try {
  await editor.isReady;
  /** Do anything you need after editor initialization */
} catch (reason) {
  console.log(`Editor.js initialization failed because of ${reason}`)
}
```


## Saving Data

Call `editor.saver.save()` and handle returned Promise with saved data.

```javascript
editor.saver.save()
  .then((savedData) => {
    console.log(savedData);
  });
```

## Features

Also, Editor.js provides useful methods to work with Editor's state.

```javascript
var editor = new EditorJS({
   // Other configuration properties

   /**
    * onReady callback
    */
   onReady: () => {console.log('Editor.js is ready to work!')},

   /**
    * onChange callback
    */
   onChange: (editorAPI, affectedBlockAPI) => {console.log('Now I know that Editor\'s content changed!')}
});
```
